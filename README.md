# ShottyNoodleFloatingSolarPanels [![RimWorld Beta 18](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-Beta%2018-brightgreen.svg)](http://rimworldgame.com/)

This mod allows you trough solar panel research to build Floatable Solar Panels on deep water.

## Features

- Floatable solar panels
- Floatable Conduits
- Substation that can function as switch between floating and land conduits for just a realism purpose right now

## Specifics

- The solar panels are only able to be build on deepwater, they are in itself walkable but very slow so that one can build outwards.
- The conduits can be build on either deep water or shallow water.
- this mod would go nicely with rainbeaus bridge mod, if you wanna go for looks.

## Bugs & to-do
- You can always find me on the rimworld Discord or at SoggyNoodle#6501
- Let me Know if marshy soil should be included for the conduits

## Credits

- Shotty for his noice art
